HAT Leffon reads Heav’n’s Master now,³>

Is't not too high for Worms below Ρ
Can most immeasurable He
Shroud in our scant capacity?
Does not the very plainest Alphabet
Of Heav'nly Wisdom pose our quickest Wit?
II.
Know then, that tho' He Sovereign be
In Wisdom's glorious Monarchy3
He's so in Mercy's too, and can

Stoop to the lowest Form of Man.

He who himself unto the Cross did bow,
Will not disdain to teach true Wisdom now.

III.
Witness his easy Lefi‘on, which

Tho’ Heav'nly‚ doth no higher reach

Than Lo-wlinqſs .- and who is he

Who here can want Capacity?
Descent's Earth's’ natural Motion, and how

Can it be hard for Sons of Clay to bow?

Come
