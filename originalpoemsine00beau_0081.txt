POEMS. 15

II.
Your little Lord that 'scapes to-day

All yours in richer Blood will pay:
First let him grow, and fill his Vcins
Whose Blood must wafh the whole World's Staius.

NE W- YEA R’s Day.

Ῐ.
Eign'd Janus, now forget thy Name‚
And both thy Faces hide for shame,
The nobler Face of Heaven- and Earth
Are join’d in this Great Infant's Birth‚
Who in his double Nature now is come
To ope the Year at Bethlehem, not at Rome.

11.
Sweet Earnest of an happy Year,

Which on thy Front all Heav⁷n dost wear,
Shine out Fair Day, that we may see
That fixircr Sun which smiles in Thee.

Shine out, that Heaven and Earth may have the Gracc
To read the Name that's printed on thy Face,

EPI-
