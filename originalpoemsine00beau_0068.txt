He makes no stay τ
Mistaken Play
Paffeth not Time away, but filly Man.

Defiance, fair impostur'd Names
Of beauteous Cheats,
Well—favour'd Lies‚ and handsome Frames
Of poison’d Sweets,

But the false Hook below
Is bearded with Vexation ; who defires
Sweetly to be
Destroyed, he
May burn in your dear Aromatick Fires.

Spring with found Joys,
Fair Heav'n, and all it's sacred Mirth

A Soul's brave thirst allay3
And those alone, those that are kindled by
The flaming grace
Of that bright Face

Which gilds the beauteous Sweets, that smile on high.
