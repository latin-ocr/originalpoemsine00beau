IV.

Corne learn of Me, for meek am Ι

And lowssy, cryeth the Most High,

Nc'er didst thou in Lyceum, ne'er

In the grave Porch this Leffon hear 3
The lofty Academy ne'er could reach
So high as this most lowly Leffon's pitch.

V.
O study then with all thy Art
This Leffon how to get by Heart:
· By Heart, by Heart it must be got,

And not upon thy outfide float,
Meekness is then right built, when thou canst find
Her Ground-work in the bottom of thy Mind.

Anger.

I.
Y F riend, run quickly to thy Glass‚
And read thy Cure in thine own Face.

Why should the Scorpion be

The readiest Remody
For his own Poison, and not thou ?
Apply, apply 3 ’twill do, I know.
