III.
What is it then, O who can tell ?

Speak Thou thyself² sweet Gabriel!

C H O R U S.
'Tis Heav'n I speak, from whence I hither came,

To shew how all it's Sweets do lie
Couch'd in one rich Epitomo

ΟΡ which great Treasure JE S U S is the Name.

HOME.

HAT is House and what is Home,
Where with Freedom thou hast room,
And may'st to all Tyrants say,
This you cannot take away?

'Tis no thing with Doors and Walls,
Which at every Earthquake falls ;
No fair Towers, whose Princely faffiion

Is but Plunder's invitation 3

No stout Marble Strud’ture, where

Walls Eternity do dare3

No Brass GateS, no Bars of Steel‚

Tho' Time's Teeth they scorn to feel:
- Brass is not so bold as Pride,

Jf on Power's Wings it ride3

Marble's
