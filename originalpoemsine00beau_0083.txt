POEMS.

ΙΙ.
Hark! now the Gates are ope, and hear

The Tune of each triumphant Sphere,
Where ev'ry Angcl as he fings

Keeps Time with his applauding Wings‚
And makes Heav'n's loftiest Roof rebound
The Echos of the noble Sound.

WHJT-SUNDAY.

1.
O U N T AI N of Sweets! Eternal Dove 1

Which leav'st thy glorious Perch above,

And hov’ring down, vouchsafest thus
To make thy Nest below with Us.

II.
Soft as thy softest Feather8‚ may
We find thy Love to us to-day3
And in the Shelter of thy Wing
Obtain thy Leave and Gracc to Sing.
