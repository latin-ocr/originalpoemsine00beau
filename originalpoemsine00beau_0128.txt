P c›E:hafi;

Who puts in me his faithful trust,
shall live ev'n in his bury'd Dust;
Nor ever shall Death’s proudest Darts
Feed on believing living Hearts.
Believ’st thou this ?

Sweet Lord‚ no more3
My Faith doth Thee as God adore,
Who from thy F ather's Bosom forth

Didst come to bring down Heav'n to Earth

MARKff32
Dear Lord, who once vouchsaf' st to let
My Ointment dew thy bleffed Feet,
O give me leave, that I before
These Altars now my Tears may pour:
That for thy Burial was ; but this

Effufion for my Brother's is.
For he, because Thou wert not here,

Ϊε flown to Heav'n to seek Thee there.
JESUSst34
W'here is he laid ?

Sweet Lord, O come,
See our Grief⁷s Monument, his T0mb‚
