Cambridge, thy genuine Mother‚

Is forc'd to be no other
But Stcp—dame, and rejed't thee,
Tho' once ssae did ele& thee.
’T is well, God does not fashion
By Man'S, his Reprobation.
Would'st if thou could'st come by it,
Thy Living hold in quiet,
And by its Profits‚ treasure
Up F uel sor thy Pleasure?
F ondling, how thou mistakest
Thy Happiness, and makest
Thy Cain, thy Loss! Th' hast gained
Not to be spent and paincd
With mystick Cares: Most mighty
Heroes who knew the wcighty
Burthcn of Souls, have faster
Flcd from the Namc of Pastor,
Thau unfledg'd Brats now hasten
Upon thiss chzzrgc to fasten.
