EPIPHANY OBLATJON.

I.

OUR Gold, rich King of Poverty, ’
Our lucense, Infant Deity‚ l)

Our Myrrh for thy Humansty,
And our poor selves we bring to Thee. ,Ι
In us our East is hither come,
To meet thine Eyes its fairer Home.
II.

This Incense let thine Altar own 3

O let this Gold wait on thy Crown: }'

And this Myrrh on thy Tomb be th rown3

And our East be thine Eyes sweet Dawn. J
So shall our other East and we

Adore no Sun, but only Thee.

ASCENSION.

I

IF T up your Heads, great GateS, and fing,

Now Glory comes, and Glory's King3
Now by your high all-golden way
The fairer Heav'n comes home to-day.

Hark !
