The Journey.

Y Parents dear to sec to—day
My Duty summons me away ;
Yet must my Heart first wait on Thee,
Great Father, both of them and me.
So guide my Journey, that I may
Remember still Thou art my Way.
Thou art my Way, and if of Thee I misS,
My plaincst Path will prove a Precipice.

How the World's amazement now doth stare
Upon this Contradifflon of the Year!
Whilst frowning January's Frost
Doth smiling Maia's Beautics blast3
Whilst Winter his chast Bounds forgets,
And on the Virgin Spring a Rape commits.

Her woeful Hcad how sadly she
