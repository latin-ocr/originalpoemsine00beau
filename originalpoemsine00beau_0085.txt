And to the Heav'nly Dove,

On vocal Wings of Love:
To Him our Thanks and Praises pay

Nor on Alabaster Hills;

Nor in Canaan's milky Rills;
Nor the dainty living Laud

Nor on Cygnets lovely Necks3
Nor in Lap of Virgin Wax3
Nor upon the soft and sscck
Pillows of the Lilly's Check3
Nor the precious smiling Heirs
Of the Morning‘s pcarly T ears;
