POEMS.

WJSHEs„

OW 1 have mind and leisurc
To trip a chearly measure,
Defire, come freely hither‚

And tell me plainly whether
Thy Wishes corne not thronging,

And make thee big with longing.
Dost hanker after Pleasures,
The Belly's lazy Treasures,
Which there will rot before thee,
And with Corruption store thee,
Providing quicker breeding
For Worms and fatter feeding?
And howsoe'er it pleasts
Cheats thee into Diseases.
Do Gold and Silver woo thee?
Abundance will undo thee.
The Metal's sad 3 be wary
How much thou striv'st to carry.

Enough is vastet Treasure‚

Than Wcalth that knows no measure,

Which Dropsy-like may kin thee,
And split‚ but ncvcr fill thee.
