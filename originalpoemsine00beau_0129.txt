POEMS. 63

JESUS. >¹2 39.
Remove the Stone.
M A R T H Α.
Corruption now
Has had four Days mature to grow:
Alas! what Comfort can we think
Such Graves’ Mouths breathe‚ but deadly Stink ἓ
¹ JESUS. x: 40.
Told 1 not thee, thy faithful Eye
God's glorious Power should descry?
Alasl thy Faith (as thou [halt see)
More dead and rotten is than he.
—Lazarus, come forth!
>h 44.
He comesu, he comes!
O mighty Word, which can from, Tombs
F right Death and Fate3 and make him, who
Is ty'd and bound, have pow't to go!

EASTER
