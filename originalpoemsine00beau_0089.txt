POEMS. 23

of treacherous Fortune3 {he who tanges
About the World with Storms of ChangeS,
And with her sudden Shocks
Dashes Prosperity upon Sorrow’s Rocks.
IV.
Why dost thou go much way about
Vain Man! to find some Treasure out?
’Tis not at City, nor at Coun,
At neighbour or at foreign Port,
Where thou can’st surely find
Thy Hopes‚ tho' firm and strong, crown'd to thy mind.
V.
O take the nearest Way: go trade
To gain a Friend, and thou hast made
A better Market far than they
Who make Returns of glittering Clay‚
Which ever was and must

Be subje& unto Envy, Thieves‚ and Rust.

VI.
Hast thou a Friendl Ο hold him fast
As thine own Soul ; and know thou hast
A Prize‚ which as most Kings defirc,
Few are so blcst as to acquire.

Greatness may F latterers gain,
But Friends scorn to be drawn by such a Chain.

Hast
