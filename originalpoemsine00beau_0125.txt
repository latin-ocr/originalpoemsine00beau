POEMS.

IX.
‘O dear Contenti,
Thou only Firmament,
Where Stars can fixed [hine3
May I in thine
Illustrious Orb, above
All Motions move!
So shall my panting Heart, with restless Rest
Wherever 1 am whirl’d about, be blest.

A Dialogue. S. Luke 16. ver. 24.

DIVES
Let thy Pity, gracious Sire,
Drop down on my tormenting F ire!

Tho‘ in profoundest Death I fry,
Alasi I have not leave to dye.
Lo! how, with my Complaint‚ the F lame
Forth from my scorched Lips doth stream:
One Drop of Water will to me
An Ocean of Comfort be t
Send Lazarus then to me beneath‚
To quench my Tongue and cool my Death.
