*On the fhme.

I.
HY Heav'nly Kingdom here below

Now like itself, dear Lord, doth shew²
And needs no Metaphor to tell
How lofty things beneath can dwell;
Now thy Celestial F lames are hither sent
To light the Stars of Earth’s new Firmament.
II.
How bright they shine! Brave Stare, whose Light
Spreads Day upon the face of Night!

And gilds the farthest ShadeS‚ which lye

Hid from the upper Heaven’s great Eye.
Coasts to the glaring Sun unknown shall say,
Welcome sweet Beams of bright Religious Day⁶

III.
These Heav'ns thy Glory shall declare,

And with thy Praises fill the Air.

The Tongues of this great Day shall send

Thy Name unto the World's vast End.
VVhere-e'er it lists this Spirit shall blow, and find
Its Chariot on the Wings of ev'ry Wind,

On
