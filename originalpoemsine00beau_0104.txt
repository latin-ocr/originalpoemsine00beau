38 POEMS.

And Sermons he ad Clerum when he please
May freely make. But have not these
Lay fimple Souls more need, good Sir,
Than your learn’d scholam, Him to hear?

VI.
Come, come3 ’twas ne’er Saint Peter’s mind

The Spirit's Sword should be confin’d,
And under his Keys locked up: 'tis you

W ho in your Latin Seabbard now

Keep it so close, I more than fear

That Rust, at least, it gathers there.

VII.
Then draw it out, for shame, and let

Careful Transsations furbish it :
The oft'ner thus you draw it, you will see

It brighter, and more genuine be.
me, draw 3 if not for Laymen, yet
For your own Priests it may be fit.
