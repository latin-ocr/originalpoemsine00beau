Vll.
Thy bless'ed Look knows how to speak

Louder than any Voice, and shake
The sturdiest Heart asunder:

ᾖ For in the radiant Treasury,

Great Lord, of thy Soul-conquering Eye‚
Both Lightning dwells and Thunder.

The Master. S. Matth. 1 1. 29.

O U L D thy Ambition paint thy Story
With Learning's never—fading Glory?
Thy aim is brave and high,
1f thou thy Master warily
Dost choose3 for such a choice, to thee
Will half the way to Learning be.
II.
Looks thy Elefflon now about
To find some Man or other out,
Whom Wisdom's Fame doth crown?
Take heed: for Error's plainly grown
So epidemical, that she
Becomes an human Property.
