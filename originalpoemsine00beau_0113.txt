POEMS.
11.

See what black Clouds thy Brow desorm
With grim Threats of th' approaching Storml
Lo! how thy pallid Cheek
And trembling Lips do seek
To make thee understand, how thou
Art posting to self-torture now!
III.
Look how thy working troubled Eye
In its own Fire doth strangely fry!

What Frowns plow up the grace
Of thy disturbed Face,

Preventing Time, and making thee
In one hour old aud wrinkled be!

IV.
On mine rely not, but receive

The Warning that thyself do'st give :
Did'st ever view a Sight
Fuller of ugly Fright ?

Be calmer then, in mercy to

Thy torturâ€™d sels, tho' not thy Foe.
