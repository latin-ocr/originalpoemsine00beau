POEMS.

1V.
But hast thou met a faithful Heart?

In spite of Fortune blest thou art.

Write others down Aequaintance‚ yet
Admit
Sole Him into thy Friends' dear Roll;

Them in thine Arms embrace, Him in thy Soul.

HONOUR

I.
MBITIOUS Sir, take heed,
For thou on Glass dost tread:
No Glass more beautiful and clear
Than all the Paths of Honour are3
No Glass more ssippery can be,
Or brittle, than deceitful She.

11.
·Ambiti0us Sir, take heed!

Thou trustest to a Reed τ
No Reeds more toss'd, and scorned by

All Winds‚ than Honour’s Bravery3

No Reed will wound more deeply thee

Who lean'st on it, than treacherous She.
