Ambitious Sir, take heed 1
Thou rid'st a dang’rous Steed:
No Steed his Crest doth more advance‚
Or proudlier than Honour prance 3
No Steed did e'er so fatally
Stumble, as most uncertain She.

IV.
Ambitious Sir, take heed!

Thou dost on Poison seed :
No Poison in a goodlier Cup
Than that of Honour served up;
No Poison c’er made Drinker be

More swollen than doth baneful She.

LO VE's‘Eye.

OLD Proverb! do not thus blaspheme:
What, is Love blind? why, G OD is Love,
And can’st thou Blindness charge on Him
Who is all Eye? Do but remove
Falso Prejudice, and thou ss1a1t find
’Tis Paffion, and not Love is blind.
