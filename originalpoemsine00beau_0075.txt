Arm‘d with lawless Strength and Might.-

Right and just Poffeffion, be

Potent Names, when Laws stand free:

House and Home, but turn thine Eye
Inward, and obscrve thy Breast;
There alone dwells solid Rest.

Which can mock all hostile Power.
To thyself a Tenant be,

And inhabit safe and free.

Girt up in a narrow Wall:

In a cleanly sober Mind

Heav'n itself full Room doth find.
