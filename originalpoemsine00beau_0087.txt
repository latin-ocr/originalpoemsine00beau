POEMS.

So shall I discern the Path
Thy sweet Law prescribed hath3
For thy ways cannot be shown

By any Light but by thine own.

An Evening Iafismn.
EVER yet could careless Sleep

On Love's watchful Eyelid creep3

Never yet could gloomy Night

Damp his Eye's immortal Light:

Love is his own Day, and sees

Whatsoe’er himself doth please:

Love his piercing Look can dart

Thro' the Shades of my dark Heart,

And read plainer far than Ι

All the Spots which there do lye.
Pardon then what thou dost see,

Mighty Love, in wretched Me:

Let the sweet Wrath of thy Ray

Chide my finful Night to Day 3

To the bleffcd Day of Grace

Whose dear East smiles in thy Face.

So no Powers of Darkncss {hall

In this Night my Soul appall;

So
