Life and W ritings of the Author. xix

the present publication requireS, that something
be said concerning his poetical writings: the oc-
caston of his falling into this way of employing
his Studie8‚ the reader may best learn from his
own words in the preface to his Psyche: ‘⁶ The
‘⁶ turbulence of these times having deprived me
‘⁶ of my wonted accommodations of study, Ι de-
“ liberated, for the avoiding of mere idlenes5‚
‘⁶ what task I might safelyest presume upon with-
“ out the society of books3 and concluded upon
“ compofing this Poem'’. Which, after having
laid before his readers the plan and machinery of
, the work, he thus concludes: ‘⁶ My desire is,
‘⁶ that this book may prompt better wits to be-
‘⁶ heve, that a divine theme is as capable and
‘⁶ happy a subje& of poetical ornament, as any
‘⁶ Pagan or Human device whatsoever. Which if
‘⁶ Ι can obtain, and (into the bargain) charm my
‘⁶ reader into any degree of devotion, 1 {hall be
‘⁶ bold to hope that Ι have partly reached my

‘⁶ proposed mark, and not continued merely
‘⁶ idle.'’
