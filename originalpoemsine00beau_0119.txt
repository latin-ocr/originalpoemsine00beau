POEMS.

And prove Death's wretched Sacrifice
Before he dies;

Whilst he himself doth to himself become
Both the dead Carcase and the living Tomb.

IV.
May some Work ever keep
My Eyes from Sleep
Whilst they are wakingl tho' it be
But some poor Song to throw at Thee,
Mischievous Sloth. Alasl I grutch
That I so much
of this my little Time expend‚ whilst Ι

All Night seal’d up in lazy Slumbers lye.
V.

The longest Summer Day
Strait posts away ε
An honestly employed Mind
Doth {hrivel'd-up December find
In wide-spread June, and thinks black Night
Crowds out fair Light
As soon when Sol thro’ lofty Cancer rides,
As when down to the Fishes Depth hc ssides.
