POEMS.

Life's Uncertainff.

WH AT ail’ st thou, to complain of what
Thy Heart believeth not?

Why cry ’st thou out on Life' s Uncertainty‚
And yet preparest not to dye?
Either thy Mock-Repinings spate,
Or else be true to thine own F ear.

II.
Yet let me tell thee, hadst thou wife
And right-discerning Eyes,
Thou might’st an advantageous Courtesy
In Life's Uncertainty espy,
And ground to thank thy Lord, that he
Let it not out by Lease to thee.

III.
This was the way Love did contrIx'c
To make thee truly live
Before thou dy’st, and after thou art dead z
The only way thy Heart to lead
On in devont reJJgiOUS Care,

And holy profitable ΗΜ.
