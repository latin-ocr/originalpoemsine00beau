Thou set’st that precious Root on whom

Grow all my Hopes; and I will from
That Soil remove him to a Bed

With Balm, and Myrrh, and Spices spread,

Where by mine Eyes’ two F ountains he
For evermore shall water'd be.

O Master !

ANGELS 1st δε 2d.
With what sweet

Fury she flies at his dear Feet,
To weep and kiss out, what she by

Her Tongue could never fignify !
O no! the Powers of sweetest Tongues

Of String or Pipe-attended Songs,
Can raisc no pitch of Joy so high
As Easter's rifing Majesty.
O glorious Resurred’tion which does risc
Above the Reach of lofticst Ecstacies!
