xxvi An Accozmt of the

his leisure hours with the Muses, he wrote a full
and clear commentary upon the Book of Eccle-
fiastes, and large critical notes upon the Penta-
teuch. In the then melancholly situation of pub-
lick affatim, the prospe& of seeing an end put to
the calamities of the nation, or to the distreffes
peculias to his brethren of the established Chumh,
wag, at least, very distant: it was this confidera-
tion which direCoed him to a close application to
Solomon's Ecclestastes‚ and to the choice of that
Book, upon which he made his first effay as a
commentator.

It would be an insult upon the Reader's under-
standing‚ to explain the reasonS, or affert the pro-
priety and seasonableness of that choice3 but it

may be affirmed, with the stri&est regard to truth
and justice, that no man ever made a better use
of the inspired Prince's instru&ion8‚ than Mr.
Beatumont: for his whole behaviour during that
gloom of distresS‚ which hung over him, was a
sort of comment upon them3 by which it appear-
ed, that he was guided by the best-grounded con-

viGfion
