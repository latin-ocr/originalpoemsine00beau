POEMs. 25

”ris not thy Fortune, tho‘ as high
As is a Crown's brave Majesty ;
But ’tis thysclf alone
Which knits Him to Thce in Lovc's Union.
XI.
Of Virtue's genuine Faithfulncss
True Love's pure Cement tempcr’d 1'33
A Cemcnt that disdains to feel
Time's Teeth‚ which triumph over Steel,
Or suffer any Harm
From angry Fortune's most outrage-tous Storm. ,
XII.
Parental Kindness cold may grow‚
And filial Duty eease to glow ; -
Ev'n matrimonial Fervour may
Be chill and faint and dyc away z
But Friendship's res’lute Heat
In Loyalty's eternal Pulse doth beat.

Tell all things else betlllxl)L ssight Eye,

T hou scorn'st their glofing Treachery3

But, next to thy Devotions‚ spend

Thy holiest Powcrs upon thy Friend.
None but thy God‚ and He

Inseparably linkcd arc to Thce.

D FRIENDS.
