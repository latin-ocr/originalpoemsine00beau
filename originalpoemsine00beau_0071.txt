POEMS. 5

V.
But now all that was Death in thee is dead;

This was thy Sting, and this lies buried
In one strong Grave3 and there must lie
'Till all the rest of thee doth die.
Look not so grim and fierce3 we know
Y'are'not our Lord‚ but Servant now.
Or rather, y'are our F riend ; do what you can
You must be courteous now, ev'n in destroying Man.
VI.

Sweet Death‚ so let me call thee now, thy Hand
Alone can bring our ffiipwreck'd Souls to Land.
Thou with this stormy Life compar'd
More calm, more sweet‚ more lovely art.
The Graves thou ope’st are but the Gates

Of blest and everlasting Fates‚
Thro' which our dying Life doth pass, to be

Born in a furer Bixth of Immortality.

Camic,
