40 P o E M s,
IV.

Thy brittle Life’s Inconstancy
Alarms thee constantly
To stand upon thy never-sseeping guard,

And Night and Day keep watch and ward :

By which stri& Discipline may'st thou
In thy Lord's service perfec} grow.
. V,
So wilt thou suffer no ssy Sin
Thy Hold to undermine;
So shalt thou fift by wife Examination

The bottom of each fair Temptation :
For Spies Temptations are, and sent

To murder thee in compliment.

VI.
Wert thou for any term secure

That this Life ffiould endure,
Aias, how eas'ly would'st thou yield to set
Up all thy Rest and Joys in it!
And never strive that Life to gain,
Which shall for evermore remain.
VII.
But now be brave, and throw disdain
On what thou find’st so vain.
