Hope.

I.
ET still bear up ·. No Bark did e'er

By stooping to the Storm of Fear
''Scape that Tempest's Wrath, which rent
Two into one Element3
Whilst into one
Confufion Ι
The groaning Air, and weeping Water run.

I .
Bear up3 and those prqud Waves which dash thee

Shall but only fairer wash thee.
Bear up 3 and thou at length shalt find

All these Blust’rings are but Wind.
Trust Hope‚ and be
Affur'd that she
Will find thee out an Haven ’midst the Sea.

Suspe& not any stony 3121st

No Rock can split Thee‚ but Thyself.

Hope casts her Anchor upward, where
No Storm durst ever domineer.

Her Hand kind she
Holds out to thee,

To bid thee welcome to ,Security.
