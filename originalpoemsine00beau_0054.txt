xlii An Account of the

The plan, which in discharge of this impor-
tant trust he marked out to himself of reading
public Lectures in Divinity twice a week in every
Terin, veae) (if not entirely new and peculiar to
himself) carried on and executed with unusual .
and unexampled affiduity3 for during the whole
term of twenty nine yearS, in which he so worthi-
ly filled that Chair, he was very seldom known
to allow himself in any omiffions of this part of
it, except when compelled by indisposition of
health3 from which cause, by the bleffing of God,
and a temperate life, no man ever had fewer in-
terruptionS.

The difficult paffages in some of St. Paul’s
Epistles‚ and the ill use to which they were drawn
by the enemies of the established Church and
true Religion, had always been a matter of great
concern to him3 and therefore he thought that
he could not do a more important service to both,
than by a clear and copious explanation of them

in the course of his LectureS. To this purpose in
a pure, unaffected‚ claffical stile, he went through

the two Epistles to the Romans and the Colo iam.
