Life and Witings of the Author. xliii

As the end of his Le&ures was to promote
true Religion, not to amuse fruitless curiosity, or
to make a vain {hew of unedifying learning, he
made it his first care to settle the true reading,
sense, and propriety of every verse according to
the most accurate Canons of Criticism3 and that
he might answer this necessary end with more
certainty, and to better effeet, he not only colla-
ted every manuscript Copy of them, but he nice-
ly examined every ancient and modern verfion,
and compared them with our own, from which he
sometimeS‚ but with great caution and modesty
dissented3 then he consulted and considered the
judgments of the Commentators in all ages and
languageS, from Chtjsostom and his followcr Theo-
plytlaffz‘, down to Grotius and other modern Ex-
pofitors of the Sacred VVritingS. When hc had
fully cleared the meaning of each paffage, he pro-
posed and explained the doffirines of Christianity
which fairly and naturally resulted from it3 set-
Iing them in a proper light to inform the under-

standingS, and direct the morals of hi< audience.
