The Rich Scorner. S. Luke 16. 21.

1

HAT Ρ shall thy Dogs more courteous

Be, than thyself, to Lazarus ξ’

49

shall their Tongues court his Sores, and thine mean while

His Misery revile?
Strange Metamorphosis! which thus doth make
The Master strive to bark, the Dogs to speak.

11.
Take heed: the Play may soon be done ε
For in Life’s Comedy not one
of all the Aets but well may be the last.
O do but then forecast
What thy high Part will prove, when thou [halt be
Qite level'd by the just Catastrophe.

III.
May not thine Exit follow’d be

With hellish Hiffings ? May not he
His Plaudit find clap'd by fair Angels' Wings?
Come, come, great Sir, these things
Are not vain Fancy's Froth3 Life, tho' it be
A Play, will prove a real History.
