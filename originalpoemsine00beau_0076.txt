POEMS.

And keep House in peace, tho' all
'fh’ Universe's Fabrick fall.

No Disaster can distress thee,

Nor no F ury dispoffess thee:

Let all War and Plunder come,

Still may'st thou dwell safe at Home.
Home is every where to thee,

Who can'st thine own Dwelling be3

Yea‚ tho' ruthless Death affail thee,

Still thy Lodging will not fail thee:

Still thy Soul's thine own3 and she

To an House remov'd shall be,

An eternal House above,

Wall’d, and roof’d‚ and pav'd with Love.
There shall these Mud—walls of thine

Gallantly repair'd out-{hine
Mortal Stars3 —No Stars {hall be

In that Heav'n but such as Thee.
