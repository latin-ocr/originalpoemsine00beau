ABRAHAM. Μι.

When Mofis and the Prophets can

Not rouse th·' impenitent Heart of Man,
No Resurrefflon from the Dead

Will raise him from his finful Bed.

A Dialogue. S.John 1 1 . ver. 21.

Ε ΑΤΙ-Ῑ had not ventur'd to draw near,

Hadst Thou, Great Lord of Life, been here.
But in thine absence bold he grew,
And us in our dear Brother ssew.

Thy Brother fell, when he was flam,
But to rebound to Life again.
MARTHA. ᾧ. 24.
1 know that he shall raise his Head
Again, when Time is put to bed 3
When thy great Trump shall summon forth
The World, and wake up Dust from Earth.

Already Faith's clear Eye in me

May Life and Resurreffion see.
