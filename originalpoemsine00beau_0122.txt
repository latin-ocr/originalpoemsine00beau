Content. Philip. 4. 1 1.

J.

IV IN E Content!
Ο could the World resent
How much of Bliss doth lye
Wrap’d up in thy
Delicious Name3 and at
How low a Rate
Thou might'st be bought ; no Trade would driven be
To purchase any Weakh, but only Thee!

11.
Thee, precious Thee,

Who can’st make Poverty
As rich as th’ Eastern Shore,
Or Western Ore ;
And furnish Job a Seat
More fair and sweet
Upon the Dunghill, than the glitt’ring Throne
Of Glory's Darling, pompous Salomon.
ΙΙΙ.
And why may I
Not valiantly defy
The Face of any Storm

Mischance can arm
Against
