POEMS.

IV.
There must my Mirth's Tunes taken be
Not by mine own, but by my Convive's Key ι
My Words and Smiles must temporize‚
And I myself a Saerifice
Must on that Humour's Altar yield‚

Which there the Company shall please to build.

V.
If there on every Dish Ι tast,

’Tis not myself, but some Disease I feast ;
My Friend susped‘cs if l forbear,

That I negledt him and his Cheer:
Nor is it easy to prevent

Or mine own Mischief, or his Discontent.

VI.
But Home, sweet Home, releaseth me

From, anxious Joys, into the Liberty
Of unsollicitous Delight 3
Which howsoever mean and ssight,
By being absolutely free

Enthrones me in Contentment's Monarchy.
