20 POEMS.

Nor the Silver-ffia1nil1g Gracc
Of the Moon's unclouded Face:
No 3 all these Candours
Are but the handsome Slanders
Cast on the Name of genuine Whsteness, which
Doth Thee alone, fair Chastity‚ enrich.

A Morm'ng Iafilmn.

HAT’s this Morn's bright Eye to Me,
If I see not thine and Thee,

Fairer J E S U3 in whose Face
All my Heaven is spread ! Alas,
Still I grovel in dead Night‚
Whilst I want thy living Light 3,
Dreaming with wide open Eyes
Fond fantastick vanities.

Shine, my only Day—Star, {hinet
So mine Eyes ssaass wake by thine 5Δ
So the Dreams I grope in now
To clear Vifions all shall grow3
So my Day shall measur’d be
By thy Grace’s Clarity3

So
