When Thou and He on Earth did* dwell,
Thou hadst thy Heav'n, and He his Hell:
But changed both, you now do reign,
In Pleasure He, and thou in⁴ Pain.

ff. 26.
Befides, between our Realm and yours,

A mighty Gulph the way devours,
And frights all feet from vent'ring thro’
From you to us, and us to you.

T hen let him warn my Brethren, how

To 'scape this Sink of Deaths below :
'Tis Loss more than enough, that thus
Hel] has gain’d One of Six of us.

ABRAHAnffisszq
What other Preachers need they, who

May to the Law and Prophets go?

DIVES.Q32
If one from Death to Life repent,

’Twill make them alfo penitent:
A dead T ongue moves the quickliest, and
No Pulpits can like Graves command.
