POEMS.

IV.
O then take her aboard, altho'
All other Wares thou out dost throw ;
Thy Bark will only lighter bc

By Hope's chearly Company ;
Tho' she doth far

Outweigh whate'er

To stop the Waves’ wide Mouths thou threw’st in there.

V.
Hope, tho’ ssow she be, and late,

Yet outruns swift Time and F ate3
And aforehand loves to be
With most remote F fiturity.
Hope, tho’ she dies,
Immortal is,
And in Fruition's Fruit doth fairer rise.

VI.
Hope is Comfort in Distrcss 3
Hope is in Misfortune Bliss:
Hope in Sorrow is Delight 3
Hope is Day in darkest Night.
Nor wonder at
This riddling Knot,
For Hope is ev'ry Thing which {he is not.
